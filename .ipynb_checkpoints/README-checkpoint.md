# ðŸš€ SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Success Prediction and Data Analysis

This project is an end-to-end data science case study focused on analyzing and predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 launches. It involves data collection through web scraping and APIs, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning model development to predict whether a Falcon 9 rocket launch will be successful.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Collect historical SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data from multiple sources (Wikipedia, SpaceX API)
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize launch patterns and insights
- Build machine learning models to predict launch success
- Evaluate model performance

## ðŸ§° Technologies & Tools

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup
- REST API (SpaceX API)
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, etc.)
- Git/GitHub for version control

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning

After cleaning and feature engineering, various classification models were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbors

The goal was to predict whether a Falcon 9 booster would successfully land or not, based on features such as payload, launch site, orbit type, and more.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Achieved up to **X% accuracy** in predicting launch outcomes using [best model].
- Identified key features influencing launch success, such as **payload mass**, **launch site**, and **orbit type**.

## âœ… Conclusion

This project demonstrates a real-world data science workflow applied to aerospace data. It showcases skills in data collection, wrangling, visualization, and predictive modeling.
